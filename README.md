## Softrobot Motion Simulation in 2D Vascular-mimicking Network ##
- Abstract 
	- Soft continuum robots with active steerable probes capable of navigating in a complex vascular network hold great promise for medical applications. This paper reports a simulation of a soft robot controlled by an external magnetic field to navigate in a 2D vascular network. We established a DER model for the soft robot and successfully controlled the equivalent force exerted by the magnetic field to follow the desired trajectory. The next step of this project includes integration of DER mode and PD controller, soft robot model refinement, and determining collision between the robot and walls.
